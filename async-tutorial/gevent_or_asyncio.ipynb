    "\n",
    "Here is the \"behind the scenes\" of how we ended up with two completely different ways to do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Pre-Historic Era: Twisted & \"Callback Hell\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Before either of these existed, if you wanted to handle thousands of connections in Python, you used **Twisted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Problem:** It was famously difficult. You had to write \"callbacks\"—functions that called other functions that called other functions.\n",
    "* **The Result:** \"Callback Hell.\" The code was unreadable, and if one thing crashed, the whole tower fell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Gevent Rebellion: \"Just Let It Be Magic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 2009, **Gevent** arrived. Its creators had a radical idea: *“What if we didn't change the code at all? What if we just tricked Python?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Secret Sauce:** Gevent uses **Greenlets** (lightweight pseudo-threads) and **Monkey Patching**.\n",
    "* **How it worked:** You take a standard, slow, blocking Python program, run `patch_all()`, and suddenly, when the code hits `time.sleep()`, Gevent intercepts that call and says, *\"Wait! Don't actually sleep and freeze the CPU. Yield control to someone else while we wait!\"*\n",
    "* **The Vibe:** It felt like magic. You didn't have to learn new keywords. Your old code just suddenly became fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The \"Official\" Standard: Guido and Asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, didn't like the \"magic\" of Gevent. He believed in the Python Zen: **\"Explicit is better than implicit.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Birth of Asyncio (2014):** Inspired by C# and JavaScript, `asyncio` was added to the standard library.\n",
    "* **The Shift:** Instead of Gevent's \"invisible\" switching, Asyncio forced you to use keywords: `async def` and `await`.\n",
    "* **The Philosophy:** If a function is going to pause and wait, you **must** label it so the developer knows exactly where the pauses happen. No magic allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The \"Function Coloring\" Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the heart of the \"story.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **Gevent**, a function is just a function. You can call it anywhere.\n",
    "* In **Asyncio**, functions are \"colored.\" If you write an `async` function, it can only be called by other `async` functions (unless you use complex wrappers).\n",
    "* **The Consequence:** Once you start using Asyncio, you have to turn your *entire* codebase into Asyncio. It spreads like a virus. Gevent doesn't have this problem; it’s \"colorblind.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Why does PyTango support both?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python frameworks picked a side. **FastAPI** and **Sanic** chose Asyncio. **Gunicorn** and **Flask** legacy users stayed with Gevent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTango is unique** because it is a bridge to C++ hardware control.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gevent in PyTango** exists for the \"Old Guard\"—people with 100,000 lines of legacy C++ and Python code who need concurrency *today* without a 6-month refactor.\n",
